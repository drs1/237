This directory contains some simple C functions and procedures and their
translation into assembly language.  See the x86 guide for more details
on the calling conventions used here.

THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT BUILD ON A MAC due to slightly different calling
conventions and an older-style compiler.  All assembly work should be
done using Linux boxes with gcc.

To build:
  make
This constructs an executable, prog.
(type make clean to clean this directory)

The program is based on prog.c, pattern.s, and gcd.s.

The files pattern.c and gcd.c are only motivational.

Running prog generates the following output:
