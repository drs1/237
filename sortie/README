       sortie.c		The working C program, with insertionSort
       isort.s		An alternative to insertionSort (isort)
       d		some numeric data
       ds		that data sorted
       w		some long and short words
       ws		the characters of those words, sorted
       Makefile		the way things are done
       README		yup.
